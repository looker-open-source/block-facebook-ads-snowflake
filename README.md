# Facebook Ads Block

This repository contains views and explores used for the Facebook Ads Block dashboards. There are 5 dashboards that come with this block: Facebook Overview, Facebook Ads - Clicks, Facebook Ads - Conversions, Facebook Ads - Impressions and Facebook Ads - Spend. Each of the dashboards provides in-depth analysis of ad/campaign performance over a given timeframe.

This project is remotely included through the Facebook Ads Block Config project.
To pull updates from this project, update the `ref:` parameter in the manifest file. It should point to the latest commit in [block-facebook-ads](https://github.com/looker/block-facebook-ads/commits/master).
